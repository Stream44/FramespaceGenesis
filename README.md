Framespace Genesis [![Tests](https://github.com/Stream44/FramespaceGenesis/actions/workflows/test.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Stream44/FramespaceGenesis/actions/workflows/test.yaml?query=branch%3Amain)
===

*Experimental* implementations of [encapsulate](https://github.com/Stream44/encapsulate) based visual modeling engines. Models are constructed by defining components and events are generated by following an actual execution path through annotated code components.

Usage
--

[bun.sh](https://bun.sh) is required. Disable engines in `framespace.yaml` if one fails to run for you.

After cloning run:

```
bun install

# Start the workbench
bun run dev

# Open browser
open http://localhost:3000
```


Overview
===

Framespace Genesis is not an abstract modeling tool. It is a modeling engine where the model is real TypeScript code that actually executes.

![Framespace Genesis Overview](./workbench/Overview.svg)

You author **components** — encapsulated TypeScript objects with properties and methods — and wire them together through **action invocations** that form a promise chain. When the model runs, method calls between components produce an **event log** of every boundary crossing: every payload that leaves one component and enters another.

This event log, combined with a **schema** that maps components to visual elements, drives an interactive visualization governed by a layout & animation model baked into the model schema. The UI updates in realtime as code is changed.

The engine is built on [encapsulate](https://github.com/Stream44/encapsulate) which wraps TypeScript objects and intercepts boundary crossings transparently using a runtime kernel.

**What this enables:**
- Go from concrete execution → abstract model → visual representation in one system
- Model real-world flows (like credential exchanges, service interactions) as executable component graphs
- Observe data movement across component and space boundaries to identify exposure, correlation, and risk
- Transpose models directly onto actual system implementations — the components may map to real classes and services

> **This project thrives on your collaboration!**

Implementation Approach
===

A model is authored using TypeScript source files holding components where each is an [encapsulated TypeScript object](https://github.com/Stream44/encapsulate/tree/main/src/spine-contracts/CapsuleSpineContract.v0) with properties, methods, and mappings. Component aspects (properties, methods) are mapped to schema components. Schema components may in turn map to higher-order schema components.

The model code generates a single large  **capsule source tree** holding the whole graph of the model. This is the structual foundation for data processing and visualization.

The model then **executes by following the actual codepath** — object method calls create a promise chain. The encapsulate abstraction emits **boundary crossing events** whenever payloads exit or enter components and when components act internally.

These events are collected into a **boundary event log**. The schema and event log together drive a **schema-based, event-hydrated interactive visualization**.

**The primary rule:** construct a **promise graph** through all action invocations that touches every attribute and ends up in a resolved state when the model has finished executing.

Model Engines
===

Engines implement queryable graph models to drive visualizations. Each engine supportes a specific set of model features.

Encapsulate Engines
---

Query [encapsulate](https://github.com/Stream44/encapsulate) *Capsule Source Tree* and *Membrane Event* related data from:
  - [`engines/Capsule-JsonFiles-v0/`](engines/Capsule-JsonFiles-v0/) - *JSON Files* on disk
  - [`engines/Capsule-Ladybug-v0/`](engines/Capsule-Ladybug-v0/) - [ladybugdb.com](https://ladybugdb.com/) embedded database engine


Framespace Workbench
===

The workbench single-page-application presents all supported visual models for a selected **Capsule Spine Tree Instance** on the same page. The visualizations update in realtime as source code is modified.

Visualizations
===

### Framespace API

Inspect all APIs available to create visualizations to see what they return. This aids in model definition and visualization development.

See: [visualizations/FramespaceAPI/](visualizations/FramespaceAPI/)


### Capsular Spine Visual Model

Various visualizations to represent chains of [encapsulated](https://github.com/Stream44/encapsulate) components with animated execution activity.

See: [visualizations/CapsularSpine/](visualizations/CapsularSpine/)


### Quadrant Visual Model

The visualization is organized into **quadrants** with column and row trees that define the spatial layout. **Nested spaces** act as logical domains — the same identified space is the same space across quadrants, not just a visual container.

Inside spaces, **components** are the core unit. A component has **properties** (state) and **actions** (executable methods). Components can have multiple actions and attributes that define their visual and functional identity.

**Action invocations** connect components. An action payload moves from action to action — internal or external, one-to-one or fan-out to multiple invocations. Payloads cross component and space boundaries making visual effects possible.
